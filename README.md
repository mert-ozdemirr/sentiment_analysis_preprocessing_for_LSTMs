# Sentiment Analysis Preprocessing: Data Preparation for LSTMs

This project focuses on preparing and optimizing text data for an LSTM-based sentiment analysis model using the IMDB Dataset. It covers key preprocessing steps necessary for training a deep learning model on textual data, including tokenization, sequence padding, and embedding matrix creation.

Key Components:
* Data Loading & Exploration – Importing and analyzing the IMDB sentiment dataset
* Text Preprocessing – Converting text into numerical representations, handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, and sequence padding
* Word Vector Visualization – Exploring word embeddings to understand relationships between words in the dataset
* Embedding Matrix Creation – Preparing word embeddings for LSTM input
* Custom Dataset Implementation – Structuring the IMDB dataset for efficient training

Future Work:
* Implementing and optimizing the LSTM model for sentiment classification
* Fine-tuning hyperparameters for better accuracy
* Comparing different embedding techniques (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)

This project lays the foundation for building an LSTM-based sentiment classifier by ensuring high-quality input data.
